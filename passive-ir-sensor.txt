*Passive Infrared/IR Motion sensors*
Can detect changes in IR levels in zones i.e. when a human enters a room

3 pins
- ground
- digital out [will be high when motion detected]
- 3-5 V in

range ~ 7m
100 - 70 deg detection range 

plug 3 males to female jumper wires from PIR to 

Orange = PIR-VCC 3-5 V in = Purple on pi
White = PIR-OUT digital out = White on pi 
Blue = PIR-GND ground = Grey on pi

Output will always be low (0v) unless movement detected
