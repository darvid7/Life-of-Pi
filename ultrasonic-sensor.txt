*Ultrasonic Distance Sensors [HC-SR04]*
- low freq = infrasound
- high freq = ultrasound
sense object disatnce using ultrasound reflection to calculate time taken to reflect ultrasound waves b/w sensor and solid object

question: will a plastic bag be a solic object? 
idea: use ultrasonic sensor to determine if bag full
placements
- top
- side
- rim & angled

*4 pins on Ultrasonic Sensor*
- Ground (GND):
- Echo Pulose Output (ECHO):
- Trigger Pulse Input (TRIG):
- 5V Supply (Vcc):

note: Output Signal (ECHO) is 5V, Raspberry PI GIPO is 3.3V so need resistors 

*4 pins on Raspberry Pi*
[Raspberry PI <-> Ultrasonic Sensor]
- GPIO 5V (pin 2) <-> Vcc (5v power)
- GPIO GND (pin 6) <-> GND (0v Ground)
- GPIO 23 (pin 16) <-> TRIG (GIPO Output) 
- GPIO 24 (pin 18) <-> Echo (GIPO Input)

note: GPIO = general purpose input/output

*Male to female jumper wires*
Red = Vcc | breadboard = Orange
Blue = TRIG | breadboard = Green
Yellow = ECHO | breadboard = Purple
BBlack = GND | breadboard = Grey 

Ultrasonic sensor output (ECHO) will always be low (0V) unless triggered, then will output 5V (3.3 due to resistors)
So set 1 GPIO pin as output to trigger sensor and one as input to detect ECHO voltage change
